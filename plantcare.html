                If dahlias are the stars of my flower garden, tomatoes are the stars of my vegetable garden! Most of the varieties I grow and sell are heirloom varieties rather than hybrids, which means you can collect their seeds to grow the same plant.
                Heirloom varieties have been grown without cross-breeding for forty or more years. They are open-pollinated (by insect pollinators or wind), rather than artificially by hand. Most supermarket tomatoes are hybrids which have been carefully bred for qualities such as uniformity, disease resistance, and robust skin to enable shipping. Heirloom varieties, in contrast, have been saved because of their unique qualities, including colour, shape, and flavour. 
                Some heirlooms can have more susceptibility to disease than hybrids, so it is worth giving your delicious tomatoes the best chance by arming yourself with good cultivation techniques!

                  <p>
                In my opinion, the best way to keep disease and pests away from your beloved vegetables is to grow the healthiest plants possible. 
                There are specific insects that you should watch for. It is important to identify infestations early–dealing with them promptly can minimise damage to the plant and spare beneficial insects.

                <div class="h5">Aphids: </div>They come in several colours, including green, white, black and brown. They look like small round grains of rice found on the underside of leaves and new shoots, sucking up the juice and leaving behind a sticky substance called honeydew. You can blast them off of leaves with a spray of water, or spray homemade insecticidal soap made from vegetable oil and dish soap to actually kill them. Larger infestations may require removal of leaves, branches, or the entire plant. Catch the attack when it’s small!

                 I have only ever sprayed with homemade safer soap for soft-bodied insects such as aphids. I also use sticky tape and hand removal of pests when I detect a problem. The balance is that we don’t want to discourage pollinators and other insects. For the most part, a combination of respect for the Earth and sheer laziness means that my main method of pest control is to sit back and let nature do it for me. For example, ladybug larvae can eat up to and predatory wasps

                <div class="h3">How to care for your tomato plants:</div>
                
                <div>
                  <p>
                Tomatoes are native to South America–it is only by careful cultivation that they can thrive in our climate. They can be susceptible to many fungal diseases, including fusarium wilt, powdery mildew, and late blight.
                Determinate vs. Indeterminate: Tomatoes are classified as either determinate or indeterminate. Determinate tomatoes set their fruit all at once. They are usually smaller plants and are ideal for compact growing spaces. I must confess that I prefer indeterminate varieties because I love the prospect of getting more tomatoes, and I enjoy the extended time that the tomatoes must be tended.

                  <p>
                Tomatoes need full sun, so plant them in the sunniest spot you have. If you can’t plant them right away, put them under artificial lights.
                </p>
                </div>
                <div class="h4">Planting:</div>
                <div>
                  <p>
                When you plant a tomato, or any other plant, never grab the stem. Instead, place your hand in a V (spreading your thumb away from your fingers) over the top of the pot, and gently turn the pot over. Gently squeeze the sides of the pot to release the roots and soil. The plant should release into your hand, upside down. When their stems are buried, tomatoes have the amazing ability to grow roots along their stem. This benefits the plant because more roots means a sturdier, more drought-resistant plant. Either plant deeply so that only the top sets of leaves are showing, or dig a trench and lie the tomato plant on its side. As you add more soil, be careful not to squeeze the stem–any damage done to this tissue invites disease. Instead, gently firm the soil around the stem and roots. 
                Make sure to space your tomato plants far enough apart so that the leaves of mature plants will not touch. This also allows you to quickly identify and remove any diseased leaves, preventing transmission to neighbouring plants.  
                Water does not equal love.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                My research supervisor taught me this when I was learning to grow tomatoes at a testing facility.  Too much or too little water isn’t good for tomatoes. Too little water can lead to blossom end rot. Too much water to foster root rot, or cause the fruit to crack, making it vulnerable to mould. I find the best way to know when to water is to check your plants. In the heat of the summer, it is fairly obvious when your plants need water. They will be wilted, often the top leader is bent over, called “flagging.” Note that this can also occur when plants are suffering from root disease–the effect is the same. In either case, water is not able to get up to the higher tissues to maintain adequate turgor pressure. 
                I often need to water my tomato plants daily in high summer. This is not the case in early summer, or when plants are very small. 
                If you don’t see any obvious flagging, check the soil. If the surface looks dry, stick your finger down up to the first knuckle. If you don’t feel moisture, you need to water. 
                Water in the morning if possible. Watering in the evening puts the plant at risk from disease and pest pressure. Watering again in the middle of a hot day may be necessary, but take care not to wet the leaves, as they can become sunburned.
                Just as the fruit is ripening, ease off the water just a little if your plant can tolerate it (no flagging). This allows the flavour of the fruit to concentrate just a little more. 
                Keep the leaves dry
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Many diseases that can affect tomato plants occur as a result of too much moisture. For example, rainwater can hit the ground and the splash carries fungal spores onto the lower leaves. You can prevent this by placing your tomatoes on a sheltered patio, deck, or greenhouse. You can also remove the lower leaves. Apart from the roots, try to keep plant tissues free from moisture. When you water, try to only water the soil, and not the leaves or stem. Make sure there is good ventilation so that condensation does not collect on plant tissues. 
                </p>

                  <p>
                In vining, indeterminate varieties, pinch the suckers that sprout from the angle between the leaves and stem. This needs to be done every few days so that the plant sends energy into making fruit. 
                Remove the lowest leaves to reduce the likelihood of them catching splashes from the soil. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Remove any diseased, yellowing, or brown leaves. At the end of the season, the oldest leaves will start to yellow and die naturally. Remove these as soon as you see them.

                Like humans, most tomatoes need support. This is especially true of indeterminate or vine tomatoes. First, figure out how tall your tomato will grow, and add in about 8 inches of buried depth of the stake. This will be the height of your stake. I like to use bamboo canes or sturdy twine tied to my overhead greenhouse supports. When placing your cane, be sure that you are not hitting a root or buried stem. You will then tie your stem to the support. Make sure that your ties are loose enough to allow for thickening of the stem. I like to use natural twine or reusable tomato clips. Please avoid using plastic twine or metal twist ties as they create mess in the garden and can generally only be used once. You can also use tomato cages, but again, be careful not to pierce a buried stem and avoid the root ball. As the plant grows, drape the leaves over the rings of the cage to promote good airflow and keep the leaves from touching the ground.
                Determinate or bush tomatoes benefit from a central, sturdy stake to support the main stem 
                Indeterminate tomatoes definitely need staking–keep tying your main stem to the stake as it grows.

                Despite these challenges, raising tomatoes is a pleasure that I think everyone should experience! The smell of the leaves will never be found in a grocery store. Watching the bees discover the newly-opened flowers is so relaxing. Then the fruit is there, tiny at first, but it swells bigger every day. You watch this green wonder and one day you notice a faint blush of colour, which deepens every day until the fruit is ready to pluck and eat! Serving your own-grown delicious tomatoes to your family or your guests is an amazing feeling!
